      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am from Devon and have lived in London for 11 years, making a home here. My friends, family and community are hugely important to me. I love being outside and find great joy in growing food at the allotment I share with my partner. I am also passionate about cooking and am a keen climber.</p>

      <p>I have an academic background in maths and physics. I undertook a Physics BSc at University College London. I went on to study a PhD in Quantum Mechanics, researching quantum phenomena in semiconducting nanostructures (a crucial piece of quantum computers).</p>
     
      <p>Unfortunately, my mental health deteriorated during my PhD and I took the difficult decision not to complete my doctoral studies in 2020. This was an incredibly difficult situation at the time, and I spent a number of years doubting myself and feeling like I had failed.</p>
      
      <p>Looking back, this was one of the best things that could have happened to me. Over the past four years, I have studied advanced horticulture courses and worked as a food producer and a landscape gardener. I have also learned a huge amount about myself: what I care about, what I value in my personal and professional life, and what kind of career I can see myself in longer term.

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why this programme?</h2>
      <p>I am a natural problem solver. When I am faced with a challenge, whether in maths, coding, gardening or climbing, I search for the answer. Sometimes it may be beyond me to fix or overcome, but I find that the search for a solution is what makes me thrive.</p>
      <p>During my studies I struggled to focus as a consequence of ADHD. However, completing the projects for this application and teaching myself to code has been the first thing in a very long time that I am so passionate about that I can focus and dedicate myself to. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience to see my hard work pay off in the form of working code and functional applications. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>What excites me most about web development is the ability to take a creative idea and turn it into a functioning tool or website that can be used by people all over the world. Plus, there's always something new to learn in this field, so possibilities for innovation and creation are endless. Since leaving academia I've spent the last few years working outdoors, now I feel like it's time to get back into a career where I can put my skills to good use. I'm eager to dive into web development and see where it takes me!</p>
